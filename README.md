- **Current Role/Position:Student at Codespace**
- **Field of Interest: Hardware**

### Part 1: Self-Assessment Reflection

1. **Skills Analysis**:
    
    - I am good at interacting with people as it allows me to express my personality and hopefully make acquaintances as i progress in my journey in the IT space
    - I consider myself to be profecient at HTML whilst not an expert i consider this to be a good skill as I can produce a basic website attenting Codespace is my way of wanting to improve that and make my skill more useful within a work environment
    - I enjoy working in groups as it allows me to again show my personality and hopefully collaborate with others to create something of meaning that can help and aid people in anf outside of the IT space

    - I tend to struggle with time management often I will find myself lacking in this and may show up to events or submit projects late I consider this a weakness I need to improve on as time is valuable out in the world and wasting it can be detrimental to me 
    - I also struggle with work ethic at times and often don't finish things I start strong this is a result of poor time management and a lack of focus on work this again needs to improve as if I am to find a job I need to ensure I not only keep it but excel in the work I do to prevent lag from my department in my specific role
2. **Interests and Values**:
    
    - My interest in my career come down to one thing building I enjoy a very hands on approach with whatever I work with this includes IT as a field I am interested in especially in the hardware space as mentioned before because of this hands on approach that I seek instead of software issues and technicalities hardware provides it's own challenge in the specifics in which you build and assemble ultimately Hardware also needs software and vice versa Hardware however for me is what holds software together making it a field I want to work in long term
    - Professionalism for me is crucial in a work environment along with a hint of fun and exploration as well as not overworking employees these values for me also closely align with family values and building a community I see this reflected especially at companies like google where bikes are encouraged to be ridden in the campus along with a red slide to get down to floors instead of stairs or an elevator this for me represents family and community values by adding fun to the corporate environment

### Part 2: Career Exploration Insights

1. **Industries and Roles Explored**:
    
    - I have researched Hardware engineering, electrical engineering, software engineering and computer science 
    - I'm interested in hardware engineering as a tech student because it connects the dots between digital and physical innovation. Since each improvement drives the technology affecting our world, I enjoy the challenge of inventing and refining microchips and motherboards. I'm excited about the complicatedÂ relationships between scalability, efficiency, and performance, particularly as I investigate the relationship between software and hardware. Developing and improving these elements is like building the framework of contemporary computing. The opportunity to push limits of speed, power consumption, and design while eventually helping to create ground-breaking developments in technology motivates me.
2. **Alignment with Personal Profile**:
    
    - My values of being hands on and interacting with people certainly go with this insdustry as it will allow people to come together to share ideas on new technologies how they will look and operate within the next few years I  am always looking to the future so this applies to me a lot as I every year anticipate what the next generation of cellphones, laptops, tablets, headphones will look like whilst a major breakthroughs happen in periods of 5 to 10 years usually it's the small changes along the way that count till that next big idea this main value of anticipation for the future and wanting to move on are what I think make this career for me 
    - New designs and frameworks for all our ICT devices can always be explored the possibilities are simply endless for myself my main interest and where I feel this industry could go is with ATMs where we get out money I feel a design where it could be compacted so that cash is less hard to find and acquire that which can be done from the comfort of one's own home is something I wish to explore and I feel can be done.

### Part 3: SMART Career Goals

1. **Short-term Goals** (Next 1-2 years):
    
In the next one to two years I wish to
- Go to University to pursue a degree in the IT space to further my career with a degree as this is what I feel most companies want out of people in the IT space whilst skill plays a crucial role furthering my education is my primary goal even if the degree is not fully within the space I would be alright with it as a means to further my life in the workspace
- Finish my course at Codespcae so as to attain my job and be certified as a fullstack web-dev this is the goal for the year and has been as well as to provide myself with a stepping stone to being a hardware engineer by at least having a feel of the space
- Get a job in Web Development to further my endeavours as a hardware engineer by meeting people in the space who are already doing hardware engineering and to mentor under them and understand the job and ways in which I can acquaire the skills necessary to then go on and do it

2. **Long-term Goals** (3-5 years and beyond):
    
    - Become a Hardware engineer which is my primary goal professionally speaking and a very good one at that to allow myself to work at some of the biggest companies in the world and to then start working on creating my own company which will focus on getting goods from South Africa to impoverished countries around Africa
    - Become financially indipendent so as to allow myself to live a comfortable lifestyle as well as to allow my parents to also live a comfortable lifestyle the next 5 years will be building blocks to this and maybe not this itself however it is the start I wish for in building towards the next 10 years or so
    - One of my skills working in groups and community one of my values reflect this as I wish to help those around me and make others' lives that much more comfortbale than they are already not doing this along any team I end up working with will help me reach this goal allowing me to work in the groups I wish to

### Part 4: Action Plan

1. **Steps to Achieve Short-term Goals**:
    
    - I need to keep learning new skills be it a new language or develop new projects this will only further my skillset and further catapult me to do the most and understand more when it comes to the tech space making my transition to hardware that much more easier
    I need to research more about the role and really understand the description and requairements so as to also make it easier to transition and also understand if I really wish to do it or if it is not what I expect 
    - I need to give myself a more hands on experience with hardware by reviewing hardware and possibly also taking short courses on it like this one assembly and dis-assembnly at home may help with further understanding the field of my own accord and training myself
    - If I do not get a job financially I will need the resources to further my skills in not only the wider IT space but in Hardware for the courses and self-training I will endure and have to go through
    - I will need to apply to Universities and jobs so as to allow myself to go in and get my qualifications hopefully in that space should I do University and if it is a job gain experience
2. **Preparation for Long-term Goals**:
    
    - A degree and experience as well as acquisition of new skills will be necessary to acheiving my long term goals this is the groundwork that will need to be laid by me to end up saying I am a hardware engineer
    - This in turn will alllow me to not only acquire a job I really want but also enable me financially to start laying down work for my company and goals of financial freedom to not only retire my parents but also make a difference to the lives of people all around Africa by using the resources South Africa has and can provide as one of the biggest economies on the continent to help  
    - Whilst tech being a very big industry can help with this for me I will also need to learn skills in the financial sector and also the humanities sector to not onlyt understand charity for the people I want to help but money for the innovations in the field I wish to see happen like the "Convenient ATM"
